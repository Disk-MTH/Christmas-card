# Christmas card
This project is under development, so it is not complete. All that is indicated below is therefore not yet contractual.

## Presentation
This github repository is a project resulting from a work requested in court. The exercise was to make a little Christmas card drawn with a turtle but, the project being really simple, I decided to do things my way (while answering the basic exercise of course). In this projects I therefore use turtle for the drawing, tkinter for the GUI and (I don't know for the sound yet).
